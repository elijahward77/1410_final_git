This program is a finance manager for students. 
It opens a tkinter window that has two windows. One for creating accounts
and one for creating monthly payments that can all be withdrawn at the same
time from a specified accounts. To run the code, simply download the file and execute it. 
The program can be used to track deposits and withdrawals within an account. 
All withdrawals and deposits can be labeled and categorized.
However, all deposits will always be categorized as "income".

You can track monthly payments in the Monthly Payment window.
You can create a new type of monthly payment along with the amount. 
Then select any previously created accounts and all the monthly payments created can be withdrawn from that account.
You can also apply a monthly interest increase to all savings accounts from here. 

A third window to track budgets is there as well but the interface for that window is not complete.
